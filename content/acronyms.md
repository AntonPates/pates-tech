### NAT {#NAT}
**Network address translation** is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. The technique was originally used as a shortcut to avoid the need to readdress every host when a network was moved. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.

**Service-oriented architecture** is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies.

A **Start of Authority** record is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS) containing administrative information about the zone, especially regarding zone transfers. The SOA record format is specified in [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035).
