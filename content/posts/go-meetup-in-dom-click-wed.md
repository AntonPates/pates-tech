Last wednesday I was on Go meetup in DomClick's office. There were four reports:

1. &laquo;Personal blog on Go. The way of the beginner&raquo;. Sweet and not interesting.

2. &laquo;WebAssembly in Go 1.11&raquo; Interesting and useless at the moment for the backend developer.

3. &laquo;Let’s Go NLP&raquo;. &mdash; [github.com](https://github.com/SchadkoAO/golang-moscow-nlp). I didn't get why they didn't try any existent lib for NLP (Natural language processing) like [prose](https://github.com/jdkato/prose) and didn't add to it support of russian language?

4. &laquo;PGQ — transactional queue in Postgres. How to work with it&raquo;. &mdash; [pgqexperiment](https://github.com/furdarius/pgqexperiment). The most interesting report for me was on 99% not about golang.
